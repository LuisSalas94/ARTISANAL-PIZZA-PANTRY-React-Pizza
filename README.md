## Learning objectives

Front-End Development with React:

- Build responsive user interfaces using React components.
- Implement component-based architecture for better code organization.
- Utilize hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useRef) to manage state and side effects.
- Implement routing using React Router to enable navigation within the app.
- Integrate third-party libraries, like React Toast, for enhanced user experience.
- Implement and manage forms to collect user input (e.g., creating orders).
- Handle conditional rendering based on different states (e.g., loading, success, error).
  
State Management with Redux:

- Implement Redux to manage global state in a centralized manner.
- Define actions, reducers, and slices to modify the state.
- Use Thunk middleware for asynchronous actions (e.g., fetching data from APIs).
- Utilize selectors to efficiently extract specific data from the state.
- 
Styling and Design:

- Apply responsive design principles to ensure the app works well on various screen sizes.
- Use CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS) to style components consistently and efficiently.
- Implement dark mode to provide users with a choice of visual theme.

API Integration:

- Fetch data from external APIs using libraries like Axios.
- Handle API requests and responses, including error handling.
Utilize async/await to manage asynchronous operations effectively.
